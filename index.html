		Hey there. I am Giridaran M. Thanks for taking a look at my homepage. I am a Software Developer with commonfloor.com. 
		I graduated with a B.Tech and an M.Tech from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee in 2014. My Major was Electronics and Communication Engineering with a specialisation in Wireless Communication. In my spare time, I love to read fantasy novels and anything related to computers. My Goodreads profile is here.

			I also love to eat. Some great places to eat in places I have been to are listed in the places tab, up there /\.
			Have a look and check them out, if you are in the neighbourhood. As far as movies go, I am a big fan of the superhero genre. Usuaaly atch

		<p>I am usually in the loop with anything related to tech. So feel free to chat up regarding anything.</p>
